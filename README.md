<b>Task In Progress:</b>
- Change game "theme" (color and icons) of the entire project when a button is clicked in the ThemeViewController.

<b>Completed Tasks:</b>
- Get the Concentration game working as demonstrated in lectures 1 and 2. Type in all
the code. Do not copy/paste from anywhere.
- Add more cards to the game.
- Add a “New Game” button to your UI which ends the current game in progress and
begins a brand new game.
- Currently the cards in the Model are not randomized (that’s why matching cards end
up always in the same place in our UI). Shuffle the cards in Concentration’s init()
method.
- Add a game score label to your UI. Score the game by giving 2 points for every match
and penalizing 1 point for every previously seen card that is involved in a mismatch.
- All new UI you add should be nicely laid out and look good in portrait mode on an
iPhone X.

<b>Uncompleted Tasks:</b>
- Your architecture must make it possible to add a new theme in a single line of code.
- Tracking the flip count almost certainly does not belong in your Controller in a proper
MVC architecture. Fix that.
